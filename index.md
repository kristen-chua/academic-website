I'm a library assistant working with electronic resources at UCLA. I am also an information and research technology enthusiast. My current interests include learning more about how digital assets can be more effectively managed, shared, accessed and used. My current research at SJSU is on voice-based conversational search methods and explores the evaluation of these methods when applied to small, closed-domain interactions between human-agent pairs.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Acquisitions
- Electronic resources
- Informatics
- Conversational Search Systems
- Integrated Library Systems
