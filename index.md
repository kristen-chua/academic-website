I am a M.S. Informatics graduate student at San Jose State University and an Information Services Analyst at the California Digital Library.  My interests include  supporting information-seeking users, digital asset management, and data engineering. My research at SJSU is on voice-based conversational search methods and explores the evaluation of these methods when applied to closed-domain interactions between human-agent pairs.

I update this site periodically as time allows.

## Current Interests and Projects:
