I'm a library assistant working with electronic resources at UCLA and M.S. Informatics graduate student at San Jose State University.  My current interests include learning more about how digital assets can be more effectively managed, shared, accessed, and used. My current research at SJSU is on voice-based conversational search methods and explores the evaluation of these methods when applied to small, closed-domain interactions between human-agent pairs.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Acquisitions
- Electronic resources
- Informatics
- Conversational Search Systems
- Information technology 
- Research technology
- Information security
